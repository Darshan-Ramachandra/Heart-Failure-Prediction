# Heart Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning :heart:

## Overview üîç
A comprehensive machine learning project to predict heart failure events using clinical data. Built in a Jupyter Notebook with Python, this project explores data preprocessing, feature analysis, and compares multiple classification algorithms‚Äîhighlighting how simple biomarkers like **serum creatinine** and **age** can drive accurate predictions.

## Key Insights üìà
Derived from our research paper:
- **Biomarkers**: Only **serum creatinine** and **age** are used, making the model easy to deploy in clinical settings.
- **Top Performance**:  
  - **Gradient Boosting** achieved the highest accuracy of **0.87**.  
  - **Random Forest** and **Na√Øve Bayes** also showed strong results (accuracy ‚â• 0.84).  
- **Feature Importance**: Serum creatinine and age ranked as the most predictive features, confirmed via correlation and importance analyses.  
- **Clinical Implication**: Early detection of heart failure can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs by focusing on routinely measured biomarkers.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  - Handles missing values, outliers, normalization, and train‚Äìtest split (70:30).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
  - Correlation heatmap, age vs. patient count, gender distribution, and scatter plots.  
- **Model Comparison**  
  - Implements and evaluates:  
    - Support Vector Machines (Linear, Poly, RBF, Sigmoid)  
    - Logistic Regression  
    - Na√Øve Bayes  
    - K-Nearest Neighbors  
    - Decision Tree  
    - Random Forest  
    - AdaBoost  
    - Gradient Boosting  
    - Bagging Classifier  
- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.  
- **Visualization**  
  - Bar charts for algorithm accuracies, feature importance graphs, scatter plots.
